# Client-Server Systems (Klient-server süsteemid — 6 EAP)

Repository containing practical assignments, checkpoints, and the ongoing comprehensive project (**Piletikassa**) built throughout the "Client-Server Systems" course[cite: 30, 31].

## Repository Structure & Monorepo Layout

The repository follows a clean monorepo structure where each control work / milestone is isolated in its own dedicated directory while preserving its complete git history:

- **`KT_1/`** — Introduction, requirements, role models, system overview, and development environment setup (Lectures 1–3 fundamentals)[cite: 31].
- **`KT_2/`** — Client-side layer in depth: semantic HTML, accessibility, CSS architecture (layers, design tokens, responsive design), Vanilla JS, DOM state management, and event handling (*Piletikassa* ticket booking interface)[cite: 13, 31, 32].
- **`KT_3/`** — Client-side logic, declarative array processing, object manipulation, closures, DOM performance benchmarks, and state-to-view architecture (*Piletikassa* event statistics and interactive test bench)[cite: 2, 6, 7, 14].
- *Future `KT_4` through `KT_16` folders will be added sequentially as the course progresses.*

## Comprehensive Course Project: *Piletikassa*

Throughout the 16 lectures, all assignments contribute to building a single, robust, production-ready application: **Piletikassa** (Event Ticket Sales Platform)[cite: 30]. 

### Core Domain & Goals
* **The Core Challenge**: Selling limited event seats where hundreds of buyers attempt to book the exact same seat simultaneously[cite: 29, 30]. Atomicity, concurrency control, and database transactions (`F3.3`) ensure that *exactly one* buyer secures the seat instantly, while others are notified immediately[cite: 29].
* **Key Features**:
  * **Identity & Roles**: Email-based authentication (magic links/passwords). Two global roles (User, System Administrator). Event creation grants temporary/scoped organizer rights for that specific event[cite: 29].
  * **Seating & Holds**: Interactive seat maps (numbered or general admission with limits). Temporary 10-minute holds that expire automatically to prevent overbooking[cite: 29].
  * **Purchases & Offline Tickets**: External payment integration simulation, immutable sales records, and mobile-friendly tickets that function seamlessly even at venue entrances with zero network coverage (`F5.3`)[cite: 29].
  * **Check-in & Analytics**: QR/code scanner working offline with background synchronization, real-time attendance tracking, and comprehensive sales reports[cite: 29].
